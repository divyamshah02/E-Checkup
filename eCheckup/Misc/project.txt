see this is the final scope

i have a project 

basically client ('Ericson') needs an app - eCheckup 

for this flow

LIC will give case (policy holder who needs to revive their policy or new policy) directly to ericson's team no need of direct integration now in our app HOD will first create a case and there will be three initial type  

- VMER (video medical examination report)
- DC Visit (Diagnostic Center visit)
- Online

VMER flow-
HOD create case --> selects coordinator --> Coordinator selects tele caller --> tele caller confirm with policy holder for time of video call and move the case to vmer_med_co --> vmer_med_co does the call (nothing on our platform) and uploads the video call recording --> Coordinator checks the video call recd and submits case to LIC (now LIC hierarchy will be explained below)

DC Visit flow-
HOD create case --> selects coordinator --> Coordinator selects tele caller --> tele caller connects with policy holder and selects DC (now the dc will be pre fetched from the address of the policy holder and of not than we will list every dc to select for tele_caller) --> once the date and time is selected tele_caller will move case to DC --> DC will be epecting policy holder and does reports --> Once done than the reports will be uploaded by DC and case moved to Coordinator --> coordinator will check the report and submit the case to LIC (now LIC hierarchy will be explained below)

Online Visit flow-
Same as VMER flow just different case type


Now see this is all the happy path now at any moment of any case type if the policy holder didnt showed up at DC or for video call than the case will be moved back to the telecaller for rescheduling and notificaiton will be sent to all stakeholders

-> VMER (video medical examination report) basically in this the policy holder dont have to go to any DC 


there are more options in case

-> paid - by LIC / Self (policy holder)

-> new policy / reviveing policy


So total three type of cases - VMER, DC Visit, Online

now LIC will have this levels

HO - Regional Office - Divisional Office - Branch - DO - Agent

this is the hierarchy of the LIC all will have their accounts in our app so the case of a particular person of an agent will be visible to agent's DO (officer) and will be visile to his branch - divisional office - reginal office - HO

HO can see all the casres

now any time / date change will give notification to all the stake holders
and any case movement will be notified to all the stake holders view sms/puchnotificaiotn/mail

and now on functionality of finance Â like monthly all invoices (money to be given to DC) LIC money to be (invoice) monthly basis now there is different type of reports

so this are the users roles - Admin, HOD (main), Coordinator, Tele caller, VMER Med Co, DC and all LIC's hierarchy


did you understood the whole work flow of this project from every aspect backend / frontend / system flow and requirement

now currently i don't want you to develop any thing i want you to understand the whole project and lets discuss some gaps or issues that you think is flawed in the project ask question that will make you understand the whole project and the app is called eCheckup


now do you understand the whole project properly??
