i have a project 

basically client ('Ericson') needs an app
for this flow

LIC will give case (policy holder who needs to revive their policy) now in our app we will first create a case and there will be two initial type 
-> VMER (video medical examination report) basically in this the policy holder dont have to go to any DC (diagnosis center) the diagnosis will happen over video call
so if it is vmer than directly the coordinator (who will create case) will move the case to tele caller who will coordinate with the policy holder and will set the date / time of the vmer (vide call) now once the time is set one mail/sms/push notification will be sent to all the requires stakeholders i.e. coordinator/tele caller / policy holder and once the video call is completed than coordinator / or any other party will upload the recorded clip and will send the case to the lic 


now if it is not vmer which means the policy holder has to visit DC for verification now in this there are more options
-> paid - by LIC / Self (policy holder)
-> new policy / reviveing policy

now the process is simple once the case is created by maanger / asst manager and assigned to coordinator

the tele caller will give date - time to DC and policy holder via mail/sms/push notification to all the stake holders

now after completing the checkup DC will upload the report than coordinator will move it forward to LIC agents


now LIC will have this levels

HO
Regional Office
Divisional Office
Branch
DO 
Agent

this is the hierarchy of the LIC all will have their accounts in our app so the case of a particular person of an agent will be visible to agent's DO (officer) and will be visile to his branch - divisional office - reginal office - HO

HO can see all the casres

now any time / date change will give notification to all the stake holders


and now on functionality of finance  like monthly all invoices (money to be given to DC) LIC money to be (invoice) monthly basis now there is different type of reports



so this are the users roles - Admin, HOD (main), Manager, Asst manager, Coordinator, Tele caller, DC and all LIC's hierarchy

We are building a web/mobile app for a client (Ericson) to manage LIC policyholder medical verification cases. The app supports two primary case types: VMER (Video Medical Examination Report) where diagnosis happens via scheduled video call, and DC Visit where the policyholder physically visits a diagnostic center. The flow begins with a Manager/Assistant Manager creating a case and assigning it to a Coordinator. For VMER, the Tele Caller schedules the video call with the policyholder, notifies all stakeholders (Policyholder, Coordinator, Tele Caller), and the video is later uploaded for review. For DC cases, the Tele Caller coordinates the date/time with both the DC and policyholder, and the DC uploads the final report post checkup. All roles (Admin, HOD, Manager, Asst Manager, Coordinator, Tele Caller, DC) and LIC's full hierarchy (Agent → DO → Branch → Division → Region → HO) are onboarded with access controls. Each LIC level can see only their own and subordinate cases. The app includes real-time notifications (Email/SMS/Push) for scheduling, changes, and uploads. A Finance module tracks payments: LIC invoices (monthly billing by policy/case type) and DC payouts (based on completed cases). There’s also a Reports module for operational and financial insights. The system handles document/video uploads, scheduling calendars, status tracking, secure logins, and audit logs. The goal is a fully digitized, role-based, notification-driven platform for handling case lifecycles end-to-end, integrated with a robust admin panel and optional mobile support.
